## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits so messages pass commitlint: `type: subject` with subject in lower-case, max 72 chars.

Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore.

Examples: `feat: add login endpoint`, `fix: resolve null in health check`, `chore: bump deps`.
